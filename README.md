First ,you have to compile the native part of the project,[P7Zip](http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/),the repo comes with version 9.20.1 source.
  - Download [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/)  ,version <b>r18b</b> recommended 
  - From the command line,browse to sub-directory <b>"\p7zip_9.20.1\CPP\7zip\Android\jni"</b> and invoke <b>"ndk-build"</b>
  The first native module <b>"lib7z.so"</b> getcompiled for the <b>armeabi-v7a</b> (You can add other ABIs if you want in application.mk file).
  - Copy the compiled "lib7z.so" module to the sub-directory <b>("/Prebuilt/armeabi-v7a/")</b> under the repo .(If you targets other ABI then move to the
  appropriate folder under "/Prebuilt/..".
  - Open the ZeeArchiver project in android studio and start building the app.
